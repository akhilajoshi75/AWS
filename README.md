This repository demonstrates my ability to automate AWS infrastructure using both Python scripts and CloudFormation IaC templates.
It includes end-to-end examples of provisioning, managing, and interacting with AWS services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and CloudWatch.
This repo is designed to demonstrate:

✅ Python automation using boto3

Launch and manage EC2 instances

Upload files to S3 programmatically

Fetch and parse CloudWatch logs

Automate resource lifecycle

✅ CloudFormation Infrastructure as Code

Deploy EC2, S3, and Lambda resources

Use IAM roles and inline policies

Build reproducible cloud environments

✅ Real DevOps workflows

Scripted deployment

Automated provisioning

Configurable, reusable modules
